    <h1>Some common inline tags</h1>
    <main>
        <h2>Citing a source cite</h2>
        <p>The &lt;cite&gt; element makes it much easier for people and bots to search the code for specific information.</p>
        A great reference for these and other elements is <cite>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/</cite>
        <hr>
        <h2>Defining your abbreviation - abbr</h2>
        <p>The &lt;abbr&gt; element will display an abbreviation on the browser.  Usually it will use the title attribute which will generate an underline and also provide a full definition of the accronymn when someone hovers over the word.  If you can, put your mouse over the WD4E below.</p>
        <abbr title="sun">Sunday</abbr>, <abbr title="Monday">Mon</abbr>, <abbr title="Fri">Friday</abbr>, et. <br>
        <p>Screen readers will read out the text, but don't forget that not everyone uses a mouse to navigate a page!!   So it is always a good idea to define your acronyms somewhere in the text as well.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Specifying the use of time - time</h2>
        The &lt;time&gt; element is again a completely semantic tag - it does not change any of the styling but it can allow systems to know to associate it with a calendar.<br>
        <p>"The concert took place on<time datetime="2001-5-15T19:00">May 15</time>."</p>may look like regular text, but look at the code used to generate it:<br>
        <p>The concert took place on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2001-5-15T19:00&quot;&gt;May 15&lt;/time&gt;</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Identifying code fragment - code</h2>
        <p>The &lt;code&gt; element is often displayed in a different font, but also some (just a little)  semantic meaning.  You can use this tag or later you can use <abbr title = "Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to style anything to look more like computer code.</p>
        <hr><hr>
        <h2>Using subscripts and superscripts - sub and sup</h2>
        <p>The &lt;sub&gt; and  &lt;sup&gt; element are used to create the super and subscripts, e.g, H<sub>2</sub>O or 2<sup>nd</sup>. <br>  In the past people would often use images to display mathematical formulas, but those images weren't always accessible.<br></p>
